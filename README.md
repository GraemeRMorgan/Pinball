<h1>Installing Git on a PC</h1>

Download git for windows:
https://gitforwindows.org/

Setup an SSH key:
https://gist.github.com/adamjohnson/5682757

From here you can clone the Git Repo to a destination on your computers unsing the git bash application.

<h3>Some basic git commands</h3>
<ul>
<li>git init --> creates a git repo</li>
  <li>git branch --> displays the current branch you're on.</li>
  <li>git add --> adds your changes</li>
  <li>git commit -m "message" --> commits your added changes</li>
  <li>git push origin master --> pushes your changes to the master branch</li>
  <li>git checkout <branchName> --> switch to given branch</li>
</ul>

Here's a quick runthrough of git that I often refer to when I forget what's going on.
